import MyComponent from 'genpass'
import 'genpass/dist/index.css'

class Example extends Component {

## To test

- Ensure you have the latest dependencies by running `yarn` at repo top-level
- You may need to delete `yarn.lock` and re-run `yarn`. There is a bug where different users need a differnt yarn lock at the moment.
- Start a dev server for the libary by running `yarn start` and leave that running in a shell.
- To start the example app, `cd/example` and run `yarn start`
